## Whatsapp Xtract (2.0)

# 

<span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"> This is Whatsapp Xtract 2.0 by&nbsp;[ztedd](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=3594618)&nbsp;with a revamped user interface</span>


The core tool has been cloned from the&nbsp;[Whatsapp Xtract repo on code.google](https://code.google.com/p/hotoloti/downloads/detail?name=Whatsapp_Xtract_V2.0_2012-05-02.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=). I have not authored the original python code, I have just incorporated the new interface that I created with the existing code and so I do not take any responsibility for the functioning of the code.

Here is a&nbsp;[guide on my blog](http://sumitraj.com/extract-old-chat-messages-from-whatsapp-database/)&nbsp;on how to install and use this tool and&nbsp;[this](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1583021)&nbsp;is the link to the original official thread on xda.
